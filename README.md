<h1><b>About:</b></h1>
<p>This is a .Net Maui Issue reporting repository. Currently, .Net Maui Apps have issue related to page changing. This issue arises in MenuFlyoutItem in MenuBarItem.</p>

<h1><b>Procedure:</b></h1>
<p>When a user go to first page through MenuFlyoutItem then come back, and then try to go to <b>any</b> page(even if you choose second page if available), it fails to proceed to that page.</p>

<h1><b>How to build test case:</b></h1>
<p>Open MauiApp2.sln in Visual Studio 2022 and compile it. This does not include all of the files, so Visual Studio 2022 will take time to generate them.</p>
